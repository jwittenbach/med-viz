#Software for visualization of muscle weakness

##Introduction

Complaints of weakness are common. The neuromuscular exam is commonly performed among many specialties; specialized and detailed examinations are a mainstay of the neurological exam and central to the examination of patients with neuromuscular disorders.
In the academic medical setting, clear and informative communication between medical students, residents and attendings is critical to optimal patient care. Here we present a free, open-source software application for generating plots of muscle weakness; the plots provide an adjunct to the written tables of weakness normally used in clinical settings. The plots are informative and intuitive; they provide a platform for pattern recognition and help move the focus from trying to construct a mental image of weakness to diagnosis.


##Methods:
Clinical rationale: I’ll write this part

Software rationale: Jason can write this part — what is the software built on, why is that useful, etc


##Results:
Give use cases, convince the audience that distributions are simple to appreciate.


Jeremy, you can add your cases here. We want cases that broadly represent neurology and clear weakness differential diagnoses. Also I would like a mix of pediatric and adult conditions, if possible.


##Discussion:
Here we present free, open-source software for visualizing muscle weakness distribution.
